## Development Insights

### 1. GitHub Analytics
- Repository â†’ Insights â†’ Contributors
- View development patterns and collaboration metrics
- Track project evolution over time

### 2. Development Tags
Use prefixes to identify development areas:
- `[Laher]` - Laher's development work
- `[Kayki]` - Kayki's development work
- `[Both]` - Collaborative development

Example:
```
[Laher] Add raycasting algorithm
[Kayki] Implement texture mapping
[Both] Fix memory leaks in map parsing
```

### 3. Development Labels
Use labels to categorize development work:
- `laher-dev` - Development by Laher
- `kayki-dev` - Development by Kayki
- `collaborative` - Joint development
- `review-needed` - Needs peer review

## Weekly Check-ins

Every week, review:
1. Commit count per person
2. Lines of code added/removed
3. Number of pull requests created/reviewed
4. Issues assigned and resolved

## GitHub Features for Tracking

### 1. Enable Insights
- Repository Settings â†’ General â†’ Features
- Enable "Issues" and "Pull requests"
- Enable "Discussions" (optional)

### 2. Use Project Boards
- Create project boards for different phases
- Assign tasks to specific members
- Track progress visually

### 3. Use Milestones
- Create milestones for each phase
- Assign issues and PRs to milestones
- Track completion percentage

### 4. Regular Reviews
- Weekly contribution reviews
- Monthly workload assessment
- Adjust distribution if needed

## Fair Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Equal Participation**: Aim for 50/50 contribution split
2. **Regular Communication**: Daily standups or check-ins
3. **Code Reviews**: All code must be reviewed by the other member
4. **Documentation**: Both members should understand all parts
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Explain complex implementations to each other

## Tools for Tracking

### GitHub CLI (Optional)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# View contribution stats
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/stats/contributors
```

### Git Shortlog (Local)
```bash
# View commit count per author
git shortlog -sn

# View commits by author with details
git log --pretty=format:"%h %an %s" --graph
```
